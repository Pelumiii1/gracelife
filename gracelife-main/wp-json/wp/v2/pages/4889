Benevolent Outreaches<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">This segment of our engagement is dedicated to the carrying out of our Lord\u2019s command as specified in Luke 14:12-14.<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\">Vulnerable Groups<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\">Social Needs Intervention<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\">Counseling<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Gracelife desires to feed and support the poor and provide for their needs as much as the Lord will make provisions available through His stewards. We will open our hearts and hands as faithful channels for the flow of His resources from blessed hearts and hands to others who are less endowed and in need.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Specifically, Gracelife will offer benevolent services to the vulnerable, disabled, and handicapped. We will also provide counseling services to the bewildered, the traumatized, abused, depressed, and all persons needing spiritual guidance.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Missions Work<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We will provide needed support in all areas of Mission and Evangelism, especially as fellow helpers of the truth (3 John v8) in the following ways:<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li3\">Prayer Mobilization<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li3\">Resource Mobilization<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">This arm will identify and collaborate with the existing mission and evangelism initiatives within and outside Nigeria in order to boast and foster the work of evangelism of all mankind in all places to the uttermost part of the earth. Of particular interest to Gracelife are the missions and evangelism works in the riverine areas and the Northern part of Nigeria, the West African coast, and other international mission initiatives.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Capacity Building<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">In this arm our focus shall be on the following areas:<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\">Church growth strategies<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\">Leadership training<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Gracelife shall organize seminars\/conferences that address the broad capacity-building needs of Christian organizations as well as those that are tailored to the specific needs of desiring organizations. Special conferences designed to address identified gaps in the body of Christ and facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas shall also be organized by Gracelife.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\n<div id=\"cmsmasters_button_65718e9db29bc3_63797854\" class=\"button_wrap\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gracelife-mi.org\/donate\/\" class=\"cmsmasters_button dib\"><span>Donate Here<\/span><\/a><\/div>\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height: 100px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\u00a0<\/div>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Scope of Engagement Gracelife as an interdenominational Christian ministry will embrace: 1.
